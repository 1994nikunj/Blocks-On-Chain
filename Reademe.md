# Basic Blockchain Implementation in Python

A basic implementation of a blockchain in Python. The blockchain includes blocks that consist of a list of transactions and a nonce, and the chain is secured through the use of a SHA-256 hash function and proof-of-work.

## Features
- Adding transactions to the blockchain
- Mining blocks
- Checking the validity of the blockchain

## Components
- Transactions
- Blocks
- SHA-256 hash function
- Proof-of-work

## Usage
The code demonstrates how transactions can be added to the blockchain and how blocks can be mined. The validity of the blockchain is also checked by verifying the hashes of each block and ensuring the integrity of the previous block's hash.

## Conclusion
This code serves as a basic foundation for understanding the fundamental components of a blockchain.
